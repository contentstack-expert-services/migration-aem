Instead, all disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or our Services will be resolved through confidential binding arbitration in accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (<span class=\"body1Heavy\">&quot;Rules&quot;</span>) of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (<span class=\"body1Heavy\">&quot;JAMS&quot;</span>), which are available on the <a href=\"https://www.jamsadr.com/\" target=\"_self\">JAMS website</a> and hereby incorporated by reference. The arbitration will be held in the county in which you reside, provided that if the claim is for $25,000 or less, either you or Backcountry may choose to conduct the arbitration through a telephonic hearing. You either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the rules of JAMS or waive your opportunity to read the rules of JAMS and any claim that the rules of JAMS are unfair or should not apply for any reason.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>b.<span class=\"body1Heavy\"> You and Backcountry agree that any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services is personal to you and Backcountry and that any dispute will be resolved solely through individual arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>c. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you and Backcountry agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this Section 16 will be substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq. (the <span class=\"body1Heavy\">&quot;FAA&quot;</span>).&nbsp;&nbsp; As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court; provided, however, that the arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative action, which is prohibited by these Terms. The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual. You and Backcountry agree that for any arbitration you initiate, the party filing the claim will pay the filing fee and the parties will split the remaining JAMS fees and costs.&nbsp; You and Backcountry agree that the state or federal courts of the State of Utah and the United States sitting in Summit County, Utah have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>d. Any claim arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services must be filed within one year after such claim arose; otherwise, the claim is permanently barred, which means that you and BACKCOUNTRY will not have the right to assert the claim.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>e. You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within thirty (30) days of the date you first accepted the terms of this Section 16 by emailing <a href=\"legal@backcountry.com\">legal@backcountry.com</a>. In order to be effective, the opt-out notice must include your full name and clearly indicate your intent to opt out of binding arbitration. By opting out of binding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve Disputes in accordance with Section 17.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>f. This Section 16 will not apply to (i) small claims disputes in which you or Backcountry may seek to bring an individual action in small claims court located in the county of your billing address or (ii) disputes in which you or Backcountry seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n","cq:responsive":{"jcr:primaryType":"nt:unstructured","default":{"offset":"0","width":"12","jcr:primaryType":"nt:unstructured"}}},"spacer_copy_2070838403":{"jcr:created":"Fri Sep 02 2022 17:51:18 GMT+0000","jcr:lastModifiedBy":"cchristoffersen@backcountry.com","jcr:createdBy":"cchristoffersen@backcountry.com","sling:resourceType":"baem/components/spacer","pixels_default":"32","pixels_large":"32","pixels_medium":"32","jcr:lastModified":"Fri Sep 02 2022 17:51:50 GMT+0000","pixels_small":"32","jcr:primaryType":"nt:unstructured","pixels_base":"32"},"text_1380609253":{"jcr:created":"Mon May 09 2022 20:16:48 GMT+0000","jcr:lastModifiedBy":"cchristoffersen@backcountry.com","jcr:createdBy":"cchristoffersen@backcountry.com","textIsRich":"true","sling:resourceType":"baem/components/text","jcr:lastModified":"Mon May 09 2022 21:35:03 GMT+0000","jcr:primaryType":"nt:unstructured","text":"<p><span class=\"title3Heavy\">17 Governing Law and Venue</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"body1Heavy\">These Terms and your access to and use of our Services will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of Utah, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles (whether of Utah or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.
