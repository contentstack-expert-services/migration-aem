                "text": "<p>Ski jackets don't have to be waterproof, but it is a good idea to have a jacket that is at least water-resistant—something with water-repellent treatment on the outside. Here is an explanation of the different types of water-repellent layering.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><b>2-Layer Shells</b> - 2-layer waterproof shells are made by laminating a waterproof membrane on the inside of an outer face fabric to create the first layer. A mesh layer is then attached inside to rest against your skin to protect the laminate from sweat and friction. This reduction of friction also makes the 2-layer shell the quietest of the three. Because of this, 2-layer shells are commonly sold as urban or travel gear.</li>\r\n<li><b>2.5 Layer Shells</b> - If the 2-layer shells are quietest, then the 2.5-layer shells are most lightweight. The first layer is a durable face fabric. The second is a laminated waterproof membrane. The half layer is a thin, protective print to protect the laminate. The absence of the mesh and the laminated construction means that 2.5-layer shells, like the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.backcountry.com/backcountry-daintree-rain-jacket-womens\">Backcountry Daintree Rain Jacket</a>, are some of the most lightweight and versatile shells on the market. They are great for backpacking and as emergency shells to keep in your pack in case of inclement weather.</li>\r\n<li><b>3-Layer Shells</b> - More durable than the other two types of shells, 3-layer shells are the shell of choice for rugged use where water protection and durability are your main concerns. These shells are made by sandwiching a membrane between two fabrics: a face fabric and a liner. The face fabric on 3-layer shells will usually feature a tighter, more robust weave than that of a 2.5 or 2-layer shells. This makes the 3-layer shells heavier and more durable than the others.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n"
