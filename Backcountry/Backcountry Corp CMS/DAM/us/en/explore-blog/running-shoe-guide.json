            "text": "<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"title3Heavy\"><a id=\"Fit\"></a>Fit: &quot;Good Enough&quot; Is Not Good Enough</span></h2>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\">One of the most important considerations with a running shoe is its fit. Too tight, your foot won’t be able to flex naturally, and you’ll increase hot spots, leading to aches and blisters. Too loose, your foot will swim around inside, leading to instability and the need to overtighten your laces. Just right, your foot will stay comfortably locked in over the platform and be able to flex freely throughout your gait cycle. To get that ‘just right’ running shoe fit, you’ll need to measure your foot, compare your measurement to shoe sizing charts, and consider which closure system makes sense for you.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span class=\"body1\">Measuring: Trace your bare feet on a piece of paper. Take a ruler and measure from the tip of your longest toe to the middle of your heel on each foot tracing. You’ll use the larger measurement of the two.&nbsp;Or you can hop into a store and have a Gearhead fit you with the Brannock Device for a precise measurement.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span class=\"body1\">Size charts: Every brand has its own size chart. If you are a size 10 in one brand, you might be a size 9 in another, so it’s always important to check out the size chart for the brand you’re considering. The measurement that corresponds with each shoe size is the measurement of your foot, not the length of the shoe. Find the shoe size that corresponds to your foot measurement. When you lace up your running shoe, you should have a thumb-width amount of space between the tip of your big toe and the front of the shoe.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span class=\"body1\">Closure: Choosing a closure system comes down to preference. Here are pros and cons of the three most common running shoe closure systems:</span><ul>\r\n<li><span class=\"body1\"><a href=\"https://www.backcountry.com/running-shoes?p=Closure%3ALace\">Laces</a> are your tried-and-true. You can adjust them to your liking before each run and they’re easy to replace when needed. But you’ll have lace ends that can get caught up on debris, and you’ll need to re-tie when making space for that long-run swell.</span></li>\r\n<li><span class=\"body1\"><a href=\"https://www.backcountry.com/running-shoes?p=Closure%3ADrawcord\">Drawcord</a> systems are quick-and-easy; it’s just a simple pull and go. They can flex with your foot and easily release some space when needed, but they’re more difficult to make fine-tuned adjustments to and not easily replaced.</span></li>\r\n<li><span class=\"body1\"><a href=\"https://www.backcountry.com/running-shoes?p=Closure%3ADial\">BOA® Fit Systems</a> are quick, easy, and durable. With the turn of a dial, a cable tightens the lace cage evenly and can release tension quickly. These high-tech systems are more expensive and the most difficult to replace.&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span class=\"body1\">Medium vs Wide: <a href=\"https://www.backcountry.com/running-shoes?p=Width%3ARegular\">Medium width</a> running shoes are the standard width, while <a href=\"https://www.backcountry.com/running-shoes?p=Width%3AWide\">wide width</a> options give added space around the entire foot, especially around the base of the toes (metatarsophalangeal joint). If the shoe’s length is right but it still feels tight, you’ll want to try a wide width shoe option.&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span class=\"body1\">“Roomy toe box”: Some shoes boast of a roomy toe box, which is not a wide fit; it just means the forefoot of the shoe has a little more space than what is standard. This extra space gives your toes more room to spread out throughout the landing phase of your gait cycle. Brands known for their roomy toe box include <a href=\"https://www.backcountry.com/running-shoes?p=Brand%3A100001536\">Altra</a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"https://www.backcountry.com/running-shoes?p=Brand%3A100004540\">Topo Athletic</a>.&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span class=\"body1\">Men’s and Women’s fits: A <a href=\"https://www.backcountry.com/womens-running-shoes\">women’s running shoe</a>&nbsp;often has a narrower heel width compared to a <a href=\"https://www.backcountry.com/mens-running-shoes\">men’s running shoe</a>.&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

If your heel starts to roll too much inward (overpronation) or outward (oversupination), off the desired path, then your form gets thrown off, causing issues further up the chain, resulting in pain or injury to the ankle, knee, hip, or back. General heel deviation is referred to as instability. Whether there is instability from the gate or it creeps in with fatigue, the architecture of a shoe can help keep your heel on a healthy neutral track.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span class=\"body1\">Supination vs Pronation: </span><span class=\"body1Heavy\">Supination</span><span class=\"body1\"> is the natural outward rolling of the foot in the landing phase of a runner’s gait, while </span><span class=\"body1Heavy\">pronation</span><span class=\"body1\"> is the natural inward rolling of the foot in the landing phase. It’s when your heel starts over rolling in either direction that injuries can occur. To see if you’re favoring the inside or outside of your foot through the landing phase, check out the outsoles of your shoes. If there is greater wear on the inside of your forefoot, you are overpronating. If there is greater wear on the outside of your forefoot, you are oversupinating. If the wear on the forefoot is even, you have a neutral gait.&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span class=\"body1\"><a href=\"https://www.backcountry.com/running-shoes?p=Support+Type%3ANeutral\">Neutral running shoes</a> are the most common. They provide just the structural support needed to keep your foot locked in over the shoe’s platform.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span class=\"body1\"><a href=\"https://www.backcountry.com/running-shoes?p=Support+Type%3AStability\">Stability running shoes</a> tend to be a little more stiff than neutral running shoes, featuring firmer foams or materials that aim to keep your heel in a neutral position. There is either a firm material insert under the arch to mitigate overpronation or inserts on either side moving from the heel toward the forefoot to mitigate oversupination and overcorrection. Oftentimes, stability running shoes also feature a large, external heel counter (piece of firm material that wraps the shoe’s heel cup) to help hold your heel in a neutral position throughout your gait.&nbsp;Since stability shoes alter your natural heel-toe transition, they may not be for you if you already run pain-free.  &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span class=\"body1\"><a href=\"https://www.backcountry.com/running-shoes?p=Support+Type%3AMotion+Control\">Motion control running shoes</a> are the least common and the stiffest option, offering maximum support for those with low, flexible arches and severe heel deviation.&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

The amount and type of foam can impact how smooth, soft, and springy your strides feel. After fit, the feel of the shoe throughout your stride should be your next major consideration.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span class=\"body1Heavy\">Maximal</span><span class=\"body1\">: Running shoes with maximalist midsoles have a large stack of foam to give runners a plush ride. The idea is the increase in foam provides a greater decrease in impact forces, which appeals to distance runners and arthritic runners. The debate continues as to whether this claim is true or not with case studies to support both sides.&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span class=\"body1Heavy\">Moderate</span><span class=\"body1\">: Running shoes with a moderate midsole are the most common and the typical go-to for daily drivers.&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span class=\"body1Heavy\">Minimal</span><span class=\"body1\">: Running shoes with minimalist midsoles have the least amount of foam, which increases ground feel and decreases weight. This low-profile option is common in race-day shoes and with minimalist runners who want that barefoot running experience with a touch of protection.&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span class=\"body1\">The following ranges are a good general rule of thumb:</span><ul>\r\n<li><span class=\"body1\">Maximal &gt;32mm average stack</span></li>\r\n<li><span class=\"body1\">Moderate between about 17 and 32 mm average stack</span></li>\r\n<li><span class=\"body1\">Minimal &lt;17mm stack</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span class=\"body1Heavy\">Foams</span><span class=\"body1\">: There are various foam compositions out there. Below we cover and compare the most common you will see in today’s running shoes:</span><ul>\r\n<li><span class=\"body1Heavy\">EVA</span><span class=\"body1\"> (ethylene-vinyl acetate) foam is ultralight, soft, flexible, durable, and can be manipulated easily, which is why it is the most common foam you will find in running shoe midsoles. However, in cold temperatures, EVA tends to lose its cushy feeling.&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n<li><span class=\"body1Heavy\">PU</span><span class=\"body1\"> (polyurethane) foam is denser and heavier than EVA but has greater impact-resistance, which means it will provide a greater rebound for longer. PU foam is not used much on its own anymore but is more often added to other foams to increase durability.&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n<li><span class=\"body1Heavy\">TPU</span><span class=\"body1\"> (thermoplastic polyurethane) foam is slightly heavier than EVA but is lighter than PU and can maintain its cushy feel in cold temperatures. Plus, it provides greater energy return for longer compared to EVA. When expanded, it is referred to as eTPU and maintains the same high-energy TPU benefits but at a lighter weight than standard TPU.</span></li>\r\n<li><span class=\"body1Heavy\">PEBA</span><span class=\"body1\"> (polyether block amide)—or Pebax (trade name)—delivers extremely high energy return while remaining ultrasoft and ultralight, making it the clear frontrunner for race day. However, it is not as durable as EVA and TPU, which can make it a costly choice for a daily driver.&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n<li><span class=\"body1Heavy\">TPE</span><span class=\"body1\"> (thermoplastic elastomers) is a blanket term that could be referring to TPU, EVA, PU, PEBA, or a blend of two or more. Plus, it could also contain blowing agents, such as nitrogen and carbon dioxide that can manipulate the softness, resiliency, and weight of the foam. When a brand mentions a TPE-based foam, they are not saying exactly which polymers the foam is made of.&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span class=\"body1Heavy\">Shank</span><span class=\"body1\">: A lot of running shoes feature a firm, flexible strip of material built into the midsole, which is referred to as the shank. This small piece of material—typically plastic—gives the midsole more stability and encourages the flex point to be under the toes for more efficient transitions.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n",

Please note, zero-drop shoes require an acclimation period for those new to them since the feet, ankles, and calves will be doing a lot more work than they’re used to doing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

Here’s a breakdown of midsole tech, fit geometry, and foam blends from the top brands:</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\"><a href=\"https://www.backcountry.com/altra\">Altra</a>:&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span class=\"body1\">To give room for toes to splay, Altra threw out the standard dated running shoe shape and created their own, the FootShape fit. This design features a boxier toe box that lets your feet rest and act naturally throughout your stride, boosting stability and power.</span> </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span class=\"body1\">Expanding on their theme of an unobstructed and natural gait, Altra uses a </span><span class=\"body1Heavy\">Balanced Cushioning</span><span class=\"body1\"> platform in every shoe, which means the forefoot and heel stack heights are the same for a zero-drop running experience.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span class=\"body1\">Recognizing biological differences, Altra introduced </span><span class=\"body1Heavy\">Fit4Her</span><span class=\"body1\"> technology that features a narrower heel and midfoot, as well as a higher instep, to give the female foot a better fit.&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span class=\"body1\">For a cushioning experience that feels plush but doesn’t rob energy, Altra developed their </span><span class=\"body1Heavy\">EGO</span><span class=\"body1\"> foam (an EVA and TPU blend), which feels pillowy when standing still and highly responsive when on the move. For a softer feel, Altra compression molded EVA for their </span><span class=\"body1Heavy\">EGO MAX</span><span class=\"body1\"> foam. And for a more energized experience, Altra infused TPU to create their </span><span class=\"body1Heavy\">EGO PRO</span><span class=\"body1\"> foam.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\"><a href=\"https://www.backcountry.com/brooks-running-shoes\">Brooks</a>:&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span class=\"body1\">Improving standard EVA, Brooks developed </span><span class=\"body1Heavy\">BioMoGo DNA</span><span class=\"body1\"> foam to increase shock absorption and energy return in a more durable and completely biodegradable form.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span class=\"body1\">Enclosing energetic PU foam in a TPU casing, Brooks developed </span><span class=\"body1Heavy\">DNA AMP</span><span class=\"body1\"> foam, which beats out their top competitors in energy return by reducing energy leaks and increasing response rate.&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span class=\"body1\">To deliver an ultra-cushy ride, Brooks developed </span><span class=\"body1Heavy\">DNA LOFT</span><span class=\"body1\"> foam, combining EVA for cushioning, rubber for durability, and air to keep weight down. In </span><span class=\"body1Heavy\">DNA LOFT v3</span><span class=\"body1\">, Brooks also added nitrogen for an even lighter and cushier experience.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span class=\"body1\">To not mess with your natural gait but still offer increased stability, Brooks introduced <b>GuideRails</b>. These firm pieces of foam placed at the inside and outside of the heel gently nudge your heel back into its straight and forward position when fatigue tries to roll it out or in, helping you maintain proper joint alignment throughout your run.&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\"><a href=\"https://www.backcountry.com/craft-running-shoes\">Craft</a>:&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span class=\"body1\">For lasting shock absorption that continues to return energy through the final leg of your ultras, Craft developed the ultradurable, EVA-based </span><span class=\"body1Heavy\">Ud Foam</span><span class=\"body1\">. And when you’re racing for the podium, Craft made </span><span class=\"body1Heavy\">Ud Foam Pro</span><span class=\"body1\"> which is a lighter variation to up your pace.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span class=\"body1\">For that tried-and-true cushioning that delivers a smooth, stable ride, Craft created the EVA-based, all-around </span><span class=\"body1Heavy\">Ar Foam</span><span class=\"body1\">.&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span class=\"body1\">Taking energy-return to the next level, Craft formulated Pebax-mimicking </span><span class=\"body1Heavy\">Px Foam</span><span class=\"body1\">, which is their lightest and liveliest option.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span class=\"body1\">When race day has come and gone and it’s time for recovery, Craft’s EVA-based, nitrogen-infused </span><span class=\"body1Heavy\">Cr Foam</span><span class=\"body1\"> gives that pillowy, effortless ride your feet and joints are craving.&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\"><a href=\"https://www.backcountry.com/hoka-one-one-running-shoes\">HOKA</a>:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span class=\"body1\">Placing plush foam up top and firmer foam as the base, HOKA developed the </span><span class=\"body1Heavy\">ProFly</span><span class=\"body1\"> midsole for soft landings and snappy toe offs.&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span class=\"body1\">Meta-Rocker is the term HOKA uses to describe the rocker of their platforms. </span><span class=\"body1Heavy\">Early Stage Meta-Rocker</span><span class=\"body1\"> starts to curve up behind the metatarsal heads, which is the base of your toes, to encourage faster transitions. </span><span class=\"body1Heavy\">Late Stage Meta-Rocker</span><span class=\"body1\"> starts to curve in front of the metatarsal heads to offer more stability in the landing phase of your gait.&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span class=\"body1\">For a locked-in fit, HOKA uses their </span><span class=\"body1Heavy\">Active Foot Frame</span><span class=\"body1\"> design to achieve a comfortably secure feeling. The </span><span class=\"body1Heavy\">Rearfoot Active Foot Frame</span><span class=\"body1\"> hugs your heel to support healthy joint alignment throughout your heel-toe transitions. The </span><span class=\"body1Heavy\">Midfoot Active Foot Frame</span><span class=\"body1\"> extends the frame toward the forefoot to boost lateral stability when you’re upping the pace, which lends to more midfoot striking.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span class=\"body1\">To combat overpronation, HOKA developed </span><span class=\"body1Heavy\">J-Frame</span><span class=\"body1\"> technology, which places firmer foam under the arch to prevent your foot from rolling in when fatigued but otherwise doesn’t interfere with your stride.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\"><a href=\"https://www.backcountry.com/nike-running-shoes\">Nike</a>:&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span class=\"body1\">For a foam that maintains its soft, energized feel longer, Nike developed its ultradurable, rubber-based </span><span class=\"body1Heavy\">React</span><span class=\"body1\"> foam for your daily miles and long training runs.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span class=\"body1\">As Nike’s lightest and liveliest foam, PEBA-based </span><span class=\"body1Heavy\">ZoomX</span><span class=\"body1\"> is like a jolt of caffeine for your stride, boosting performance on race day.&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span class=\"body1\">Containing pressurized air and taut fibers inside a flexible pod, Nike introduced </span><span class=\"body1Heavy\">Zoom Air</span><span class=\"body1\"> units for added control, energy return, and agility.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span class=\"body1\">To eliminate the need for overlays and maximize airflow, Nike developed </span><span class=\"body1Heavy\">Flyknit</span><span class=\"body1\"> technology, which uses featherweight yarns and a strategic knitting process to create an ultra-breathable, low-friction, locked-in fit.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\"><a href=\"https://www.backcountry.com/on-running-shoes\">On</a>:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span class=\"body1\"><b>CloudTec</b> is On’s zero-gravity technology that uses lightweight foam and empty space to create Cloud units that absorb impact multi-directionally for soft strikes however they land.&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span class=\"body1Heavy\">Helion</span><span class=\"body1\"> is the lightweight superfoam On created that blends EVA and OBC (olefin block copolymer) foams to deliver stabilizing shock absorption with a single low-profile material.&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span class=\"body1\">As the Cloud units bounce back, their energy is compounded by On’s </span><span class=\"body1Heavy\">Speedboard</span><span class=\"body1\"> technology, which is a thin piece of flexible material within the midsole that gives an extra snappy spring to your toe offs.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"title1Heavy\">Kids’ Running Shoes: When Pitter-Patter Turns To Strides</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\">Kids’ feet continue developing until they are in their mid-teens.

If you run around 20 miles a week, then your shoes will last you 4 – 6 months.&nbsp;Over a shoe’s lifespan, the midsole becomes compacted as a result of repeated strikes, losing its ability to absorb shock and return energy.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\"> </span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\">Q: How should I breathe while running?</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1Heavy\">A</span><span class=\"body1\">: Your breathing depends on the intensity of your run. For a general rule:&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span class=\"body1\">Slow pace running: breathe in and out of your nose.</span></li>\r\n<li><span class=\"body1\">Comfortable pace running: breathe in through your nose, out through your mouth.</span></li>\r\n<li><span class=\"body1\">Tempo running and sprints: breathe in and out through your mouth.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\">Whether you’re inhaling through your nose or mouth, you want your breath to be diaphragmatic. Diaphragmatic inhales are deep, expanding your ribcage side-to-side and front-to-back, allowing your shoulders to relax rather than hunch. Whereas chest breathing is shallower, puffing your chest and putting tension into your neck and shoulders.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\">Once you get the hang of diaphragmatic breathing, you can start playing with rhythmic breathing. Take note of how many foot strikes you get in with each inhale and exhale. You should be getting in more strikes with your inhales. For example, 3:2 breathing is inhaling for 3 foot strikes and exhaling for 2. The idea of rhythmic breathing is to alternate which foot lands with the start of each exhale to reduce the stress on your body. Studies have shown the start of each exhale creates the most impact force in the landing phase of your gait. By alternating which foot strikes with each exhale, you are able to have both sides share the load evenly.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\">Q: What are the effects of running on the body?</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1Heavy\">A</span><span class=\"body1\">: Running improves your heart, lung, and mental health, as well as increases your overall strength. Studies have shown running can lower blood pressure, decrease feelings of stress and depression, improve sleep quality, and more. However, it is important to give your body the rest and recovery it needs after a run or you risk overtraining, which leads to physical injury and/or hormonal imbalance.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\">Q: How long should I run?</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1Heavy\">A</span><span class=\"body1\">: When you’re just starting out, it’s about minutes not miles. You’ll want to do walk/run intervals to slowly build up to running steady for 20 – 30 minutes. Once you can run for 20 – 30 minutes at a time, you’ll want to maintain that for about a month before thinking about increasing mileage. When adding distance, the general rule is you don’t want to add more than 10% each week. So, if you are running 3 miles, then the following week, you can up it to 3.3 miles. However, this general rule may not work well for new runners and runners coming back from injury. So, it is important to pay attention to your body. If you’re feeling sluggish or achy, consider waiting 3 – 4 weeks before upping the mileage again.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\"> Q: Is it better to run faster or longer?</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1Heavy\">A</span><span class=\"body1\">: It’s better to have a mix of both.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p><span class=\"body1\">Fast running can spike your metabolism due to it engaging more of your nervous system and boost your power performance due to it using more muscle fibers. However, fast running is harder on your joints and requires longer recovery time.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><p><span class=\"body1\">Slower running improves endurance and heart health by teaching your body how to use oxygen efficiently. Running slow and long also requires less recovery time, letting you get back out there more often.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
