This differs from off-roading, which usually takes place over a couple of hours on a day trip. Overlanding requires some form of sleeping system, nutrition provisions, hydration solutions, and certain safety precautions. Additional items including camp furniture, awnings, and solar powered accessories are also a plus. Overlanding is all about the adventure, and you get to equip yourself exactly as you see fit for the route that you decide to seek out.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n","cq:responsive":{"jcr:primaryType":"nt:unstructured","default":{"offset":"2","width":"8","jcr:primaryType":"nt:unstructured"}}},"customembed":{"embeddableResourceType":"baem/components/customembed/embeddable/youtube","jcr:created":"Thu Jul 27 2023 21:23:50 GMT+0000","jcr:lastModifiedBy":"kzylstra@backcountry.com","youtubeHeight":"600","jcr:createdBy":"kzylstra@backcountry.com","textIsRich":"true","sling:resourceType":"baem/components/customembed","type":"embeddable","background_color":"white","youtubeVideoId":"7kQU2BVsCas","jcr:lastModified":"Thu Jul 27 2023 21:28:15 GMT+0000","youtubeWidth":"1245","jcr:primaryType":"nt:unstructured"},"text_330776224":{"jcr:created":"Wed Jul 12 2023 22:16:02 GMT+0000","jcr:lastModifiedBy":"kzylstra@backcountry.com","jcr:createdBy":"kzylstra@backcountry.com","textIsRich":"true","sling:resourceType":"baem/components/text","jcr:lastModified":"Fri Jul 14 2023 22:11:22 GMT+0000","jcr:primaryType":"nt:unstructured","text":"<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</h2>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"title3\"><a id=\"basics\"></a>Overlanding Basics</span></h2>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</h2>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\">A successful overlanding trip is all about preparation. We already touched on the gear-intensive nature of the activity, but what about the car? All-wheel or four-wheel drive is preferred, and some decent vehicle ground clearance is mandatory for intermediate to advanced off-roading. Route planning is another key part of preparation, so we’ll touch on navigation apps and getting the info you need outside of cell service.

Boulders can often protrude more than 12 inches from the ground surface and need to be steered around or carefully maneuvered to avoid contact with your vehicle. Shallow mud ruts and puddle crossings are common at the intermediate level.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1Heavy\">Advanced off-roading</span><span class=\"body1\">&nbsp;represents the most demanding terrain, with driving surfaces including anything from deep mud ruts to large boulders that outsize your entire vehicle’s footprint. Stream crossings are also common at the advanced level.</span><br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\"><br>\r\n</span>&nbsp;</p>\r\n","cq:responsive":{"jcr:primaryType":"nt:unstructured","default":{"offset":"2","width":"8","jcr:primaryType":"nt:unstructured"}}},"image_1115703353":{"aspect_ratio":"2:1","jcr:created":"Wed Jul 12 2023 22:20:01 GMT+0000","jcr:lastModifiedBy":"kzylstra@backcountry.com","jcr:createdBy":"kzylstra@backcountry.com","alt":"Gear bin","sling:resourceType":"baem/components/image","jcr:lastModified":"Wed Jul 12 2023 22:20:46 GMT+0000","jcr:primaryType":"nt:unstructured","fileReference":"/content/dam/bcs/projects/bc23_exp_0072_overlanding/BCWoodward_220326_00349.jpg","cq:responsive":{"jcr:primaryType":"nt:unstructured","default":{"offset":"1","width":"10","jcr:primaryType":"nt:unstructured"}}},"text_1328603331":{"jcr:created":"Wed Jul 12 2023 22:22:09 GMT+0000","jcr:lastModifiedBy":"kzylstra@backcountry.com","jcr:createdBy":"kzylstra@backcountry.com","textIsRich":"true","sling:resourceType":"baem/components/text","jcr:lastModified":"Mon Jul 17 2023 20:40:03 GMT+0000","jcr:primaryType":"nt:unstructured","text":"<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"title3\"><a id=\"checklist\"></a>Gear Checklist</span></h2>\r\n<p><br>\r\n<span class=\"body1\">This list includes the basic requirements for camp setup, which is also covered in depth in our <a href=\"https://www.backcountry.com/explore/packing-list-car-camping\">Camping Checklist article.</a> We also include sections for off-roading gear and advanced off-roading gear. It’s important to note that there are endless vehicle accessories for overlanding, and these lists are not comprehensive.&nbsp;</span><br>\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<h3><span class=\"title2Heavy\">Camp Setup</span></h3>\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<h3><span class=\"title1\"><a href=\"https://www.backcountry.com/rooftop-tents\">Rooftop Tent</a></span></h3>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\">Soft-shell rooftop tents are less expensive and come in larger sizes, but hard-shell tents are faster to set up and inherently more durable.&nbsp;Rooftop tents simplify camp setup and breakdown drastically, which is important for overlanding because you’re always on the move. That being said, a standard&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.backcountry.com/tents-shelters\">ground tent</a>&nbsp;is totally usable for shorter trips, or if you don’t mind the extra time spent on setup and takedown.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3><span class=\"title1\"><a href=\"https://www.backcountry.com/roof-racks-accessories\">Roof Rack</a></span></h3>\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\">Roof racks are the best way to optimize space on your rig, with options to mount awnings, shovels, and more accessories in addition to a rooftop tent.&nbsp;You also need to make sure your roof rack or crossbars can support the weight of your rooftop tent with people in it. &nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1Heavy\">Gearhead Tip:</span><span class=\"body1\"> Dynamic weight is the weight that your roof rack or crossbars can support while the vehicle is in motion. Static weight is the weight that your roof rack or crossbars can support while the vehicle is stationary. You need to make sure the static weight rating is enough to support the weight of your tent plus the weight of the people that will be sleeping in it.</span> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3><span class=\"title1\"><a href=\"https://www.backcountry.com/sleeping-bags\">Sleeping Bag</a></span></h3>\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\">There are numerous different&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.backcountry.com/search?s=u&amp;q=sleeping+bags\">sleeping bag</a>&nbsp;temperature ratings, weights, and insulation types to choose from. Pick one based on your body shape and size and the temperatures in which you’ll be sleeping.</span><br>\r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span class=\"body1\"><a href=\"https://www.backcountry.com/synthetic-sleeping-bags\">Synthetic fill bags</a>&nbsp;are good for car camping because they are inexpensive. They’re less packable than down, but that’s generally all right for car camping where space is less of a concern. Synthetic insulation can pack out in just a few years, however, so it’s not the most durable choice.&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n<li><span class=\"body1\"><a href=\"https://www.backcountry.com/down-sleeping-bags\">Down fill bags</a>&nbsp;are more expensive but longer lasting than synthetic bags. A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.backcountry.com/western-mountaineering-sleeping-bags\">quality down bag</a>&nbsp;will be light, pack small, and last more than 20 years.&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n<li><span class=\"body1\">Temperature ratings on sleeping bags usually refer to survival, not comfort, so aim for a bag with a lower rating than the temperature in which you’ll be camping.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><span class=\"body1\">A 30-degree bag is great for general summer use.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li><span class=\"body1\">A 20- or 15-degree bag works well for three-season use. If you’re unsure of the weather, it’s always worth adding a few blankets or quilts to the car, just in case.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3><span class=\"title1\"><a href=\"https://www.backcountry.com/sleeping-pads\">Sleeping Pad</a></span></h3>\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\">Many rooftop tents come with integrated sleeping pads, but many campers still like to add another sleeping pad on top for enhanced comfort.</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span class=\"body1\"><a href=\"https://www.backcountry.com/stoic-double-cloud-camp-bed-lux\">Stoic Double Cloud Camp Bed LUX</a></span><br>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<h3><span class=\"title1\"><a href=\"https://www.backcountry.com/stoves-grills\">Stove</a></span></h3>\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\">A good camp stove is essential for basic cooking and boiling water for coffee.

Crossovers and SUVs make excellent overlanding rigs and often deliver better gas mileage. Trucks and vans certainly have their purposes too, and offer lots of space for gear.&nbsp;</span><br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3><span class=\"title2\">AWD vs. 4WD vs. 2WD</span></h3>\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\">All-wheel drive and four-wheel drive vehicles are often preferred for overlanding adventures because they provide enhanced traction. This helps out in intermediate to advanced off-roading scenarios, and can even be essential for mild terrain if it’s wet, muddy, sandy, or snowy. Two-wheel drive vehicles can still be used for overlanding, but relatively dry and beginner-friendly off-road terrain is recommended for these vehicles.&nbsp;</span><br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3><span class=\"title2\">Vehicle Ground Clearance</span></h3>\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\">Ground clearance is the measurement from the lowest point of your vehicle to the ground. This is an important consideration because it determines the maximum height of an obstacle that your vehicle will be able to clear, and how deep of a rut you can navigate without “high-centering” your vehicle.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\">For beginner off-roading, 5 inches of ground clearance is generally the minimum amount for basic dirt road travel. For intermediate off-roading, 8 inches of ground clearance is the minimal amount for safe travel. For advanced off-roading, 10+ inches of clearance are required to maximize your vehicle’s potential. It’s important to note that some vehicles can gain ground clearance with aftermarket lift kits, wheels, and tires.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\">High-centering: When part of your vehicle becomes stuck on terrain that is higher than your wheels.</span><br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3><span class=\"title2\">Angles</span></h3>\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\">Approach angles and departure angles are essentially the angles that determine how steep an incline your vehicle can ascend and descend without making contact with the ground. A vehicle with good departure angles generally requires less ground clearance because the bumpers won’t hang up when entering and exiting obstacles. This is often why some crossovers perform relatively well off-road even with only eight to nine inches of ground clearance.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\">The approach angle is the angle from the point where the front tires contact the ground to the frontmost part of the vehicle, typically the front bumper. This determines how steep an incline your vehicle can ascend without scraping the ground.&nbsp;</span><br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p><br>\r\n<span class=\"body1\">The departure angle is the angle from where the rear tires touch the ground to the rearmost part of the vehicle, usually the rear bumper. This determines how steep an incline your vehicle can descend without the bumper hitting the ground.</span><br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3><span class=\"title2\">Limitations</span></h3>\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\">It’s essential to understand your vehicle’s limitations so you can make informed decisions about terrain selection. Your tire choice has a huge impact on your vehicle’s capabilities, and an all-terrain tire often strikes a great balance between off-road performance and on-road efficiency. It’s also important to factor in your cargo space when planning a trip to ensure you can actually carry sufficient supplies to get you through your journey.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n","cq:responsive":{"jcr:primaryType":"nt:unstructured","default":{"offset":"2","width":"8","jcr:primaryType":"nt:unstructured"}}},"image_1830657232":{"aspect_ratio":"2:1","jcr:created":"Wed Jul 12 2023 23:01:12 GMT+0000","jcr:lastModifiedBy":"kzylstra@backcountry.com","jcr:createdBy":"kzylstra@backcountry.com","alt":"RAV4 RTT","sling:resourceType":"baem/components/image","jcr:lastModified":"Wed Jul 12 2023 23:02:35 GMT+0000","jcr:primaryType":"nt:unstructured","fileReference":"/content/dam/bcs/projects/bc23_exp_0072_overlanding/BCWS_220203_1368.jpg","cq:responsive":{"jcr:primaryType":"nt:unstructured","default":{"offset":"1","width":"10","jcr:primaryType":"nt:unstructured"}}},"text_466488518":{"jcr:created":"Wed Jul 12 2023 23:03:02 GMT+0000","jcr:lastModifiedBy":"kzylstra@backcountry.com","jcr:createdBy":"kzylstra@backcountry.com","textIsRich":"true","sling:resourceType":"baem/components/text","jcr:lastModified":"Fri Jul 14 2023 22:06:03 GMT+0000","jcr:primaryType":"nt:unstructured","text":"<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"title2\"><a id=\"where\"></a>Where To Go</span></h2>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\">There are many ways to navigate in remote terrain, and a smartphone is often sufficient for navigation on many overlanding routes. In more remote terrain, we recommend a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.backcountry.com/gps\">handheld GPS</a>&nbsp;or even a trusty paper atlas. There are also some awesome mapping applications for your smartphone like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.onxmaps.com/offroad/app\">ONX OFFROAD</a>&nbsp;that make things easier, although most of these apps require a paid subscription. We recommend finding an experienced mentor to show you some routes that are established before venturing deep into the unknown.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"title2\"><a id=\"safety\"></a>Safety</span></h3>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\">Two aspects of self-reliance are understanding how to prioritize safety and being prepared for anything. We covered some key safety items in the Gear Checklist above, but we want to emphasize the importance of a first-aid kit, and basic vehicle safety equipment like jumper cables, a tow strap, and a tire repair kit. Another important piece of safety gear is a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.backcountry.com/gps\">satellite communication device</a>, which allows you to communicate with preset contacts without cellular reception.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n","cq:responsive":{"jcr:primaryType":"nt:unstructured","default":{"offset":"2","width":"8","jcr:primaryType":"nt:unstructured"}}},"image_1182078397":{"aspect_ratio":"2:1","jcr:created":"Fri Jul 14 2023 21:35:16 GMT+0000","jcr:lastModifiedBy":"kzylstra@backcountry.com","jcr:createdBy":"kzylstra@backcountry.com","alt":"Power bank and Sat phone","sling:resourceType":"baem/components/image","jcr:lastModified":"Fri Jul 14 2023 21:53:38 GMT+0000","jcr:primaryType":"nt:unstructured","fileReference":"/content/dam/bcs/projects/bc23_exp_0072_overlanding/BCWoodward_220326_00424.jpg","cq:responsive":{"jcr:primaryType":"nt:unstructured","default":{"offset":"1","width":"10","jcr:primaryType":"nt:unstructured"}}},"text":{"jcr:created":"Fri Jul 14 2023 21:37:37 GMT+0000","jcr:lastModifiedBy":"kzylstra@backcountry.com","jcr:createdBy":"kzylstra@backcountry.com","textIsRich":"true","sling:resourceType":"baem/components/text","jcr:lastModified":"Fri Aug 04 2023 00:06:02 GMT+0000","jcr:primaryType":"nt:unstructured","text":"<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"title3\"><a id=\"informative\"></a>Informative Links</span></h2>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span class=\"body1\">Shop <a href=\"https://www.backcountry.com/overlanding\">Everything Overlanding</a></span></li>\r\n<li><span class=\"body1\">Shop <a href=\"https://www.backcountry.com/hike-camp\">Everything Hike &amp; Camp</a></span></li>\r\n<li><span class=\"body1\">Shop <a href=\"https://www.backcountry.com/travel\">Everything Travel&nbsp;</a></span></li>\r\n<li><span class=\"body1\">Read <a href=\"https://www.backcountry.com/explore/how-to-choose-the-right-camping-sleep-system\">How To Choose The Right Sleep System</a></span></li>\r\n<li><span class=\"body1\">Read <a href=\"https://www.backcountry.com/explore/camping-with-care\">Camping With Care</a></span></li>\r\n<li><span class=\"body1\">Read <a href=\"https://www.backcountry.com/explore/packing-list-car-camping\">Camping Checklist</a></span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"title3\">FAQ</span></h2>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</h2>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\">Q: What is overlanding?</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\">A: Overlanding is self-reliant vehicular travel that takes place on- or off-road, typically over the course of more than one day.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\">Q: What is the difference between off-roading and overlanding?</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\">A: Off-roading typically takes place over the course of a daytrip, usually a handful of hours or less. Overlanding takes place over multiple days, and often includes some driving on paved roads.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\">Q: Do you need 4WD/AWD for overlanding?</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\">A: No, you don’t need 4WD or AWD for overlanding. While it can be useful for advanced off-roading scenarios, many overlanding routes are smooth enough for vehicles with 4x4 to remain in 2-wheel-drive over the course of the entire route. If you don’t have 4WD or AWD and you find yourself questioning a particularly challenging section of trail, we recommend you turn around and find another route.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\">Q: How much do rooftop tents weigh?</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"body1\">A: Typically between 80 to 180 pounds. &nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n","cq:responsive":{"jcr:primaryType":"nt:unstructured","default":{"offset":"2","width":"8","jcr:primaryType":"nt:unstructured"}}},"image_1110420436":{"aspect_ratio":"2:1","jcr:created":"Fri Jul 14 2023 21:50:10 GMT+0000","jcr:lastModifiedBy":"kzylstra@backcountry.com","jcr:createdBy":"kzylstra@backcountry.com","alt":"Camp vehicles overhead","sling:resourceType":"baem/components/image","jcr:lastModified":"Fri Jul 14 2023 21:53:49 GMT+0000","jcr:primaryType":"nt:unstructured","fileReference":"/content/dam/bcs/projects/bc23_exp_0072_overlanding/BCWoodward_220326_01883.jpg","cq:responsive":{"jcr:primaryType":"nt:unstructured","default":{"offset":"0","width":"12","jcr:primaryType":"nt:unstructured"}}}}}}}}
