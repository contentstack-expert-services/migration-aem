Just be aware that you’ll likely want another backpack or duffel for your street clothes and personal items, too, and that additional carry-on bag fees could apply.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Another approach is to simply tie or strap your ski/snowboard boots to your carry-on bag, or to just throw them over your shoulder as a carry-on. It might feel a little less organized, but knowing that your boots will arrive at your destination (even if your ski/board bag doesn’t) adds peace-of-mind. Plus, having your own perfectly fitting boots makes renting simpler and more comfortable.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>We've had great success fitting street and mountain gear in a ski touring bag or small hiking bag.

Some bags come with security locks built-in, so you may want to consider those. Or you can use a padlock to secure zippers or the openings of your bag.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n","cq:responsive":{"jcr:primaryType":"nt:unstructured","default":{"offset":"2","width":"8","jcr:primaryType":"nt:unstructured"}}},"text_260635330_copy__561951005":{"jcr:created":"Fri Oct 27 2023 16:33:11 GMT+0000","jcr:lastModifiedBy":"alwright@backcountry.com","jcr:createdBy":"alwright@backcountry.com","textIsRich":"true","sling:resourceType":"baem/components/text","jcr:lastModified":"Mon Oct 30 2023 19:45:05 GMT+0000","jcr:primaryType":"nt:unstructured","text":"<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"title2Heavy\"><a id=\"links\"></a>Informative Links</span></h2>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.backcountry.com/backcountry-double-ski-snowboard-rolling-bag\">Backcountry Double Ski &amp; Snowboard Rolling Bag</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.backcountry.com/backcountry-ski-boot-bag\">Backcountry Ski &amp; Snowboard Boot Bag</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.backcountry.com/travel\">Travel Gear</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n","cq:responsive":{"jcr:primaryType":"nt:unstructured","default":{"offset":"2","width":"8","jcr:primaryType":"nt:unstructured"}}},"text_260635330_copy__422938692":{"jcr:created":"Fri Oct 27 2023 16:33:11 GMT+0000","jcr:lastModifiedBy":"alwright@backcountry.com","jcr:createdBy":"alwright@backcountry.com","textIsRich":"true","sling:resourceType":"baem/components/text","jcr:lastModified":"Mon Oct 30 2023 19:45:00 GMT+0000","jcr:primaryType":"nt:unstructured","text":"<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"title2Heavy\"><a id=\"FAQ\"></a>FAQ</span></h2>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<p>Q: What are the best ski and snowboard bags for traveling?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><b>A:&nbsp;</b>The best ski or snowboard bags for traveling will depend on the needs of your trip and your gear. We prefer a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.backcountry.com/backcountry-double-ski-snowboard-rolling-bag\">rolling ski or snowboard bag</a>&nbsp;that protects and has room for multiple skis or boards—and for other winter gear, too.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Q: Can I take skis on the plane?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><b>A:&nbsp;</b>You can absolutely fly with skis. You’ll just need a ski- or snowboard-specific bag, and you'll need to comply with your <a href=\"#airlines\">airline’s baggage policy</a>.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Q: How much can my ski or snowboard bag weigh?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><b>A:&nbsp;</b>Generally, your bag must weigh less than 50 pounds to avoid added checked-bag fees. However, some airlines will allow ski or snowboard bags to be heavier, so it's best to check your <a href=\"#airlines\">airline’s rules</a> before your trip.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Q: Can you pack skis and a snowboard in the same bag?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><b>A: </b>You can pack skis and a snowboard in the same bag, just be sure to follow your <a href=\"#airlines\">airline’s checked-bag weight limits</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n","cq:responsive":{"jcr:primaryType":"nt:unstructured","default":{"offset":"2","width":"8","jcr:primaryType":"nt:unstructured"}}},"button":{"jcr:created":"Mon Oct 30 2023 17:58:52 GMT+0000","jcr:lastModifiedBy":"kzylstra@backcountry.com","jcr:createdBy":"kzylstra@backcountry.com","link":"https://www.backcountry.com/service/backcountry-bulletin","sling:resourceType":"baem/components/button","jcr:title":"Back To The Bulletin","jcr:lastModified":"Mon Oct 30 2023 17:59:20 GMT+0000","variant":"brand","jcr:primaryType":"nt:unstructured","alignment":"center"}}}}}}
